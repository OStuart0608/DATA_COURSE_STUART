2.  My Idea for my final project has to do specifically with healthcare. A data set I found had to do with estimating the burden of diseases, injuries and other risk factors globally for 21 regions from 1990 to 2010. 

3. The data set I collected was an excel file taken from 7 public data sets you can analyze for free right now. (2017). Tableau Software. https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/free-public-data-sets

data_disease %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Country Name`, 
                       y = `Number of Deaths`,
  )) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  labs(title = 'Number of Deaths per Country',
       x = 'Country Name',
       y = 'Number of Deaths') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust = 1 ))
